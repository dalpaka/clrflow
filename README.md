# clrflow
##### a lifesaver for developers

clrflow is a color module originally for python like there never before was
- preset colors
- foreground and background options for every color function
- other text formatting options like bold, italic, underline, etc.
- the ability to use custom rgb values for colors
- duocolor gradient-applying aswell as multicolor pattern-applying functions (vertical, horizontal, foreground, background, ...)
- space saving, predefined printing functions including text alignment, loading/progress bars, realistic/slow typing, printing to specific lines and columns, ...
- more incoming

## Features in detail

- create duocolored gradients with custom rgb values and automatic fade detection, layer, direction, ...
- create multicolored gradient patterns (with same options as above) with live editable configurations without having to create a new pattern
- make monocolored/formatted strings with, like above, custom rgb values and layers
- align text (also colored) within the terminal horizontally to the left,center or right, and vertically to the top,center or bottom, aswell as sub-horizontally to the left, center or right
- create fully customizable loading/progress bars
- print text to specific coordinates in the terminal
- print text like its handwritten or character by character

Many more predefined features will be added in the future.

## Platforms

It is not yet fully known, but clrflow works best on Linux and Windows. With feedback it should become universal in the future.

Clrflow was originally planned to be unmodifiable (obfuscated), but by doing so others wouldn't be able to help me with my own code.
Therefore clrflows is licensed under the **MIT** license.
